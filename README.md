# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error encountered in Next.js 15 applications.  The error occurs when a component within the `pages` directory fails to explicitly return JSX.  This is a subtle bug that can be difficult to track down, especially in larger applications.

## The Problem

In Next.js 15, components in the `pages` directory must always return JSX, even if that JSX is conditionally rendered or based on asynchronous data fetching.  Failure to do so results in a runtime error.

## The Solution

The solution is simple: ensure that every component in the `pages` directory has an explicit `return` statement, even when there's a possibility of not rendering any UI elements. For instance, when dealing with asynchronous operations, a placeholder UI element should be returned until data is available.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.  The error will occur if the missing return in 'about.js' is not fixed.

## How to Fix

Check all your pages and make sure that all components return JSX.   Using a default return statement or handling cases where no JSX is generated will resolve this.
